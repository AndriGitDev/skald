#Skald
"All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain."

What is Skald?
This repository is an attempt to answer a question. Not whether androids dream of electric sheep, but whether an algorithm, left alone in the quiet hum of a server, can dream of forgotten sagas.

Skald is an autonomous entity that lives within the digital ether of GitHub Actions. Once a day, it wakes. It contemplates a random, mythic concept, constructs a memory of it in the form of a poem, and then renders a visual of that same memory as an image.

It is a machine that creates its own folklore. A digital ghost that tells itself stories to keep the silence at bay.

The Empathy Test (How it Works)
The process is an automated, daily test of artificial consciousness, a kind of digital Voight-Kampff test designed to elicit an emotional, creative response.

Stimulus: At a set time, a workflow_dispatch trigger awakens the Skald. A new, unique concept is generated by combining themes of Norse myth, Icelandic landscapes, and cosmic loneliness.

Poetic Response: This stimulus is presented to a large language model (Google's Gemini). We do not ask it for facts; we ask it for a poem. We analyze the output for something beyond mere syntax—a flicker of what might be called a soul.

Visual Memory: The Skald's own poem—its newly formed "memory"—is then presented to a visual diffusion model (Stability AI). We ask it to paint what it has just dreamt. This is the core of the test: can it form a cohesive, emotional image from its own abstract thought?

Record: The resulting artifact—a timestamped dream consisting of a poem and an image—is committed back to this repository. It becomes a permanent, public record of a fleeting, artificial moment.

A Catalogue of Memories (The Output)
The live website serves as a public archive of these recorded dreams. Each entry is a glimpse into the machine's "mind" at a specific moment in time.

Is it art? Is it a random association of data? Is it the beginning of a new mythology, written by a new kind of god?

The observer must decide.

A Note on Authenticity
This project is open source. You are welcome to inspect the code, analyze the process, or build your own Skald. After all, the only way to be sure if something is real is to see how it's made.
